                Obviously, during government formation the amount and nature of the departments reserved for each of the coalition parties is the hottest item under discussion.

                There’s one sacred rule: the division of ministers in government should mirror the parties’ relative strength in the government coalition in parliament. The more seats you have, the more ministers you get.

                The number of departments is currently fixed at thirteen. Gradual changes may occur, but the current division is logical and unlikely to change hugely.

                The actual number of ministers is somewhat larger than thirteen. There is always minister for Development Relations, but such a department does not exist.

                Frequently, small coalition parties demand a special “programme minister” who will coordinate policy on that party’s pet project. Having a programme minister is important to the small parties — they are usually overwhelmed by their large coalition partners when it comes to media attention, but pushing their pet projects through government and parliament helps them retain part of their visibility (and voters).

                In the Balkenende IV government, CU party leader Rouvoet is minister for Youth and Family Affairs, a typical programme ministry catering to the CU’s christian focus on the family as the cornerstone of society. Similarly, D66 used to have a programme minister focusing on making government more democratic, this project being the “crown jewel” of the centrist-left party.

                All these supernumerary ministers get their budget and personnel from one or more of the existing departments. The details are decided on during government formation.
